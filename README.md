# Your force Gym

**YourForceGym** site: [visit here](https://diogo-pessoa.github.io/YourForceGym/index.html). 

This project aims to provide a responsive web-page to create an online presence to a Gym. It aims to provide the user with clear reasons to sign-up with the least possible navigation time.  
A catching `Gallery` and  `About Us` section is available on the menu. 
For the impatient user, there's a `find-us` link for a navigation map. 

## UX 
Designed with a mobile-first approach. The emphasis is to take advantage of the gym's member's peer recommendation. Allowing new users to check the gym on the spot from anywhere. It aims to provide the user with clear reasons to sign-up with the least possible navigation time. 
Yet there are alternatives built-in for users looking to know more before making a decision.
