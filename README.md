# Your force Gym

**YourForceGym** site: [visit here](https://diogo-pessoa.github.io/YourForceGym/index.html)

This project aims to provide a responsive web-page to create an online presence to a Gym. 

The goal is to provide the user with clear reasons to sign-up with the least possible clicks. With a mobile first approach the landing page has enough information for a sign-up on the spot.

Yet there are alternatives built on this design.

For users that want more information before making a decision. A catching gallery and an About Us section are available on the menu. 

Lastly for the impatient user there's a find-us link for a navigation map.

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
